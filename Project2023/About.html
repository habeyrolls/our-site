			<p>
			Founded in 2023 by Mr. +___________________________, the organization started as an idea raised to inspire idle and less occupied youths in productive ways of spending their time away from the challenges and temptation of an idle mind in the slums.
			The Organization started with football as the main activity inviting area youths (boys) to train and form a football team. This was realized by the formation of a football team, Echo United Football Club that has since then actively engaged in area tournaments and football leagues within the structures. </p>
			<p>However, the leaders and members letter discovered that football alone wasn’t sufficient to transform youth live hoods. Football did not only limit the scoop of beneficiaries by gender but also failed to attend to the core challenges affecting societies and youths today; economic transformation. At that time, there was popular demand for the organization to broaden its focus to include economic transformation programs.  
			Furthermore, after research _______, it was noted that the youths find Unemployment as the major challenge affecting their lives. “We want to work but have nothing to do!” a popular saying from the research. </p>
			<p>The organization then introduced seven (7) More areas of focus: Agriculture (poultry and pig farming), small scale industries (Liquid soap and Candle making), Art and Craft, Metal fabrication, Carpentry, Savings scheme, Humanitarianism (charity work) specifically targeting social economic transformation. </p>
			<p>Today the organization has already established capacity to produce in the small scale industries, liquid soap, and candle making. In partnership with one of our members, we have also established a carpentry shop. Art and craft is ongoing and we intend to kick start on poultry farming in the closest time. Sports are actively ongoing. 
			The organization was founded on the principles of synergism, transparency and moral uprightness. These are the disciplines that drive our day to day engagements to the cause; to date.
